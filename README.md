# Caesars_Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known *ciphers* is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

A common modern use is the [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) cipher, where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places. Thus 'A' ↔ 'N', 'B' ↔ 'O' and so on.

Write a function which takes a [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not transform any non-alphabetic character (i.e. spaces, punctuation), but do pass them on.

Remember to use [Read-Search-Ask](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) if you get stuck. Try to pair program. Write your own code.
